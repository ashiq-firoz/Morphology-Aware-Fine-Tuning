सिद्धांत के बिल्कुल विपरीत थी कि इंडोनेशिया एक \"विंगवेस्ट\" (लाभ कमाने वाला क्षेत्र) था। इसने आधुनिक विकास नीति की शुरुआत को भी चिह्नित किया; जबकि अन्य औपनिवेशिक शक्तियों ने एक सभ्य मिशन की बात की,

मूल आबादी के लिए उपलब्ध हो गई, हालांकि केवल अमीर लोग ही माध्यमिक और तृतीयक संस्थानों में ट्यूशन का खर्च उठा सकते थे, जहां डच शिक्षा की प्राथमिक भाषा है। जावानीस में, प्रियायी पुरुष औपनिवेशिक सिविल

लिए उसकी आँखें खोलीं। वयस्क होने के बाद, जावानीस परंपरा ने तय किया कि कार्तिनी एक युवा महिला कुलीन के रूप में आश्रय में जीवन व्यतीत करेगी। इस दौरान, कार्तिनी ने अपने डच स्कूल के साथियों को पत्र लिखे, जिसमें जावानीस परंपराओं द्वारा बढ़ावा दी गई लैंगिक असमानता को उजागर किया गया, जिसमें कम उम्र में जबरन विवाह और महिलाओं को शिक्षा से वंचित करना शामिल था। डच सरकार की मदद से, कार्तिनी ने लड़कियों के लिए पहला इंडोनेशियाई प्राथमिक स्कूल खोला, जिसमें सभी इंडोनेशियाई लड़कियों को सामाजिक स्थिति की परवाह किए बिना भाग लेने की अनुमति थी। 1904 में उनकी मृत्यु के बाद, उनके पत्र प्रकाशित हुए और इंडोनेशिया में

समस्याओं पर विफल रही। सबसे पहले, नीति के कार्यक्रमों को आवंटित बजट इसके लक्ष्यों को प्राप्त करने के लिए कभी भी पर्याप्त नहीं थे, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप कई औपनिवेशिक अधिकारी स्थायी प्रगति प्राप्त करने की संभावना से मोहभंग हो गए। महामंदी की वित्तीय तंगी ने नीति को निश्चित रूप से समाप्त कर दिया। दूसरा, नीति के शैक्षिक कार्यक्रमों ने इंडोनेशियाई राष्ट्रीय पुनरुद्धार में महत्वपूर्ण योगदान दिया, जिससे इंडोनेशियाई लोगों को संगठित होने और औपनिवेशिक शासन के प्रति अपनी आपत्तियों को व्यक्त करने के लिए बौद्धिक उपकरण मिले। परिणामस्वरूप, औपनिवेशिक प्रतिष्ठान में कई लोगों ने नीति को एक गलती के रूप में देखा
